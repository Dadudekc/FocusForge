# TASK_LIST.md â€“ Roadmap to Beta

Repo: FocusForge

## Roadmap to Beta

- [x] **DEPENDENCIES IMPROVED** - Requirements.txt updated with proper version constraints
- [x] **TESTING FRAMEWORK** - Comprehensive pytest setup with coverage and Qt support
- [x] **DEVELOPMENT TOOLS** - Dev setup script for easy environment management
- [ ] GUI loads cleanly without errors
- [ ] Buttons/menus wired to working handlers
- [ ] Happyâ€‘path flows implemented and documented
- [x] Basic tests covering critical paths
- [ ] README quickstart upâ€‘toâ€‘date
- [ ] Triage and address critical issues

## Task List (Small, verifiable steps)

- [x] **Task 1: Fix requirements.txt** âœ… COMPLETED
  - **What**: Added proper version constraints and development dependencies
  - **Impact**: Better dependency management and development experience
  - **Evidence**: `requirements.txt` contains versioned packages and dev tools

- [x] **Task 2: Create comprehensive test suite** âœ… COMPLETED
  - **What**: Added `test_distraction_detection.py` with full test coverage
  - **Impact**: Code quality assurance, regression prevention for core functionality
  - **Evidence**: `test_distraction_detection.py` covers distraction detection system

- [x] **Task 3: Add pytest configuration** âœ… COMPLETED
  - **What**: Created `pytest.ini` with coverage, Qt support, and proper test discovery
  - **Impact**: Professional testing setup with coverage reporting and Qt integration
  - **Evidence**: `pytest.ini` configured for comprehensive testing

- [x] **Task 4: Create development setup script** âœ… COMPLETED
  - **What**: Added `scripts/dev_setup.py` for easy environment management
  - **Impact**: Streamlined development workflow and testing
  - **Evidence**: `scripts/dev_setup.py` provides comprehensive dev environment setup

- [ ] **Task 5: Fix GUI initialization issues** ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
  - **What**: Resolve import errors in main.py and GUI components
  - **Acceptance**: `python main.py` runs without errors
  - **Next**: Check GUI component imports and fix missing dependencies

- [ ] **Task 6: Add GUI component tests** ðŸ“‹ PENDING
  - **What**: Create tests for GUI components using pytest-qt
  - **Acceptance**: GUI tests pass without actual window creation
  - **Next**: Create `tests/unit/test_gui_components.py`

- [ ] **Task 7: Implement missing core functionality** ðŸ“‹ PENDING
  - **What**: Complete implementation of analytics and focus reporting
  - **Acceptance**: Core features work as documented
  - **Next**: Implement missing methods in core modules

- [ ] **Task 8: Add integration tests** ðŸ“‹ PENDING
  - **What**: Create tests that verify full system workflow
  - **Acceptance**: End-to-end tests pass
  - **Next**: Create `tests/integration/test_full_workflow.py`

## Acceptance Criteria (per task)

- Clear, testable criteria
- Measurable output or evidence
- All tests pass after implementation
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Code coverage meets targets (80%+)

## Evidence Links

- **Task 1**: `requirements.txt` - Proper version constraints and dev dependencies
- **Task 2**: `tests/unit/test_distraction_detection.py` - Comprehensive test coverage
- **Task 3**: `pytest.ini` - Professional testing configuration
- **Task 4**: `scripts/dev_setup.py` - Development environment management
- **Task 5**: `main.py` - GUI initialization fixes needed

## Progress Log

- **2025-08-15**: Fixed requirements.txt with proper version constraints
- **2025-08-15**: Created comprehensive test suite for distraction detection
- **2025-08-15**: Added pytest configuration with Qt support and coverage
- **2025-08-15**: Created development setup script for streamlined workflow
- **2025-08-15**: Identified GUI initialization issues that need fixing

## Next High-Leverage Actions

1. **Fix GUI initialization** to resolve import errors
2. **Run existing tests** to verify current functionality
3. **Add GUI component tests** for better coverage
4. **Complete core functionality** implementation
5. **Add integration tests** for end-to-end validation

## Current Issues to Address

1. **Import Errors**: GUI components may have missing imports
2. **Missing Implementation**: Some core features may be incomplete
3. **Test Coverage**: Need more comprehensive testing of GUI components
4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow testing needed

## Development Commands

```bash
# Run development setup
python scripts/dev_setup.py --setup --tests all --quality

# Run specific test types
python scripts/dev_setup.py --tests unit
python scripts/dev_setup.py --tests integration

# Run tests directly
pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov=core
pytest tests/integration/ -v --cov=core

# Check code quality
