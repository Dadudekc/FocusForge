## üìù Devlog Summary
In the depths of the Digital Dreamscape, where code fragments float like memories, I found the ruins of an ancient system. Today, I begin the resurrection of Focus Forge, not as it was, but as it was meant to be. The first step is always the hardest, but the Dreamer's Code demands we begin.
