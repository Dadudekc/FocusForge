## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [FR1] Monitor and detect user distractions in real-time with configurable sensitivity
- [FR2] Track focus sessions with start/stop functionality and duration logging
- [FR3] Generate comprehensive focus reports with session analytics and trends
- [FR4] Provide gamified meta-skills system with progression tracking
- [FR5] Implement Kanban-style task management with drag-and-drop interface
- [FR6] Export data to CSV format for external analysis and backup
- [FR7] Support multiple user profiles with personalized settings

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [NFR1] Application startup time under 3 seconds on standard hardware

- **Framework**: PyQt5 for GUI, SQLite3 for data storage
- **Database**: SQLite3 with automatic schema management
- **Architecture**: Modular design with separated concerns (core, gui, analytics)
- **Testing**: pytest framework with comprehensive test coverage
- **Dependencies**: PyQt5, SQLite3, pytest, logging framework

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2025-08-15 to 2025-08-22 - Core distraction detection and basic GUI
- **Phase 2**: 2025-08-23 to 2025-08-30 - Analytics system and task management
- **Phase 3**: 2025-09-01 to 2025-09-07 - Gamification and advanced features
- **Phase 4**: 2025-09-08 to 2025-09-14 - Testing, optimization, and deployment

## Acceptance Criteria
- [AC1] Distraction detection system accurately identifies user distractions with 90%+ precision
- [AC2] Focus session tracking maintains accurate timing and session data
- [FR3] Analytics system generates comprehensive reports with all required metrics
- [AC4] GUI is responsive and intuitive with all core functionality accessible
- [AC5] Task management system supports basic CRUD operations for projects
- [AC6] Data export functionality generates valid CSV files with complete session data
- [AC7] Application runs stably for extended periods without memory leaks

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk 1**: Distraction detection accuracy issues - Mitigation: Implement multiple detection methods and user calibration
- **Risk 2**: GUI performance degradation with large datasets - Mitigation: Implement data pagination and lazy loading
- **Risk 3**: Cross-platform compatibility issues - Mitigation: Use platform-agnostic libraries and comprehensive testing
- **Risk 4**: Data loss during application crashes - Mitigation: Implement automatic backups and transaction-based database operations
